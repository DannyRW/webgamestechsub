					<h1>Wait For Backup</h1>

					<p>You wait for backup outside the house, as the sounds of siren draws close you hear another shot. </p>
					<p>As you and the others clear the building what you find just keeps getting worse and worse. </p>
					<p>A woman in the living room with a bullet in her abdomen led in shattered glass that used to be a coffee table, dead from her wounds. </p>
					<p>A man in the basement dead on the floor with a gun by his side </p>
					<p>and lastly a young boy in his room, hiding under his bed, confused and crying.</p>
