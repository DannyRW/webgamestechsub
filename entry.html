					<h1>Entering the house</h1>

					<p>You walk slowly up to the house, gun drawn moving slowly when you reach the front door you find it unlocked and head inside. </p>
					<p>You enter a hall, thereâ€™s breathing to your right, slow and pained, coming from the living room, the door is just ahead. </p>
					<p>On the left hand side of the hall opposite the other door is a way through to the kitchen. </p>
					<p>And at the far end of the hall are two sets of stairs, one going upstairs and one down to the basement. </p>
					<p>The last thing you notice is muffled crying, it sounds like it's coming from above you.</p>
