					<p>Itâ€™s late on a Friday night, it's late and raining, your shift's almost over, but you got one last call just before heading home.</p>
					<p>You are the first to respond to a call in the suburbs. Neighbours called it in, shouting and arguing followed by screaming and shooting. </p>
					<p>Backups on the way and there's at least one armed suspect in the house but if any of those shots hit someone they might not have much time...</p>
